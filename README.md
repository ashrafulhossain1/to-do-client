# Task Management Application - Frontend

##  Description
This is the frontend for a Task Management Application built with React and Vite.js. Users can add, edit, delete, and reorder tasks using a drag-and-drop interface. Tasks are categorized into three sections: **To-Do**, **In Progress**, and **Done**. The app has a clean, minimalistic UI and is fully responsive for both desktop and mobile users. Firebase Authentication (Google Sign-In) is implemented for user login.
